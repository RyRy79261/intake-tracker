# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-02)

**Core value:** Accurate, queryable health data across intake, vitals, and medication adherence — structured for cross-domain analysis and future AI querying
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Schema Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 11 (Schema Foundation)
Plan: 1 of 3 in current phase
Status: Executing — Plan 01-01 complete, Plan 01-02 next
Last activity: 2026-03-02 — Completed Plan 01-01 (test infrastructure setup)

Progress: [#░░░░░░░░░] 3%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 3 min
- Total execution time: 0.05 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 - Schema Foundation | 1 | 3 min | 3 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (3 min)
- Trend: baseline

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-phase]: Build order is non-negotiable — schema before services, services before UI (Dexie migrations are irreversible)
- [Pre-phase]: `currentStock` derived from `inventoryTransactions` sum, never stored as mutable counter (sync-hostile pattern eliminated)
- [Pre-phase]: Phase 5 (Security) depends on Phase 2 only — can run parallel to Phase 3 if needed
- [Pre-phase]: useLiveQuery vs. React Query reactivity decision is an open architectural question — must be resolved before Phase 3 begins (see research/SUMMARY.md)
- [01-01]: Node environment (not jsdom) for vitest since fake-indexeddb patches global IDB directly
- [01-01]: Explicit vitest imports (globals: false) for clarity and IDE support
- [01-01]: Fixture factories use `as Type` casts for forward-compat with Plan 01-02 schema additions

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Pre-phase]: useLiveQuery vs. React Query reactivity pattern must be decided explicitly before Phase 3 (Service Layer Rebuild). Options documented in .planning/research/PITFALLS.md. Failure to decide before Phase 3 planning risks hooks being written inconsistently.
- [Pre-phase]: "NanoDB" identity unconfirmed — PROJECT.md references it as future cloud sync target, but likely means Dexie Cloud. Does not block this milestone.
