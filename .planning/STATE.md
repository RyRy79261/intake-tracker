## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-phase]: Build order is non-negotiable — schema before services, services before UI (Dexie migrations are irreversible)
- [Pre-phase]: `currentStock` derived from `inventoryTransactions` sum, never stored as mutable counter (sync-hostile pattern eliminated)
- [Pre-phase]: Phase 5 (Security) depends on Phase 2 only — can run parallel to Phase 3 if needed
- [Pre-phase]: useLiveQuery vs. React Query reactivity decision is an open architectural question — must be resolved before Phase 3 begins (see research/SUMMARY.md)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Pre-phase]: useLiveQuery vs. React Query reactivity pattern must be decided explicitly before Phase 3 (Service Layer Rebuild). Options documented in .planning/research/PITFALLS.md. Failure to decide before Phase 3 planning risks hooks being written inconsistently.
- [Pre-phase]: "NanoDB" identity unconfirmed — PROJECT.md references it as future cloud sync target, but likely means Dexie Cloud. Does not block this milestone.
